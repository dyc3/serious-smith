## How to play

* WASD to move
* Left shift to dash
* You will hit tennis balls automatically
* Collect the green experience orbs to gain experience.

Your health and experience bars are in the top left corner of the screen (in that order).
When your health reaches 0, you lose.
When your experence bar fills up, you level up, and you become more powerful.
